## Overview

### Introduction

The **Water Quality Monitoring Platform** is designed to track and analyze water quality in real-time across municipal, industrial, and natural water sources. By leveraging IoT sensors, data analytics, and AI, the system detects contaminants, monitors chemical levels, and provides actionable insights to ensure safe and sustainable water usage.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Data ingestion from **10 million IoT sensors**.
- **Contamination Detection:** AI-based models for identifying anomalies.
- **Automated Alerts:** Threshold breach notifications.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Maintenance forecasts and trend analysis.
- **External API Integrations:** Municipal, industrial, and environmental platform support.
- **Scalability & High Availability:** Robust distributed infrastructure with load balancing, caching, and asynchronous task processing.

### Ingress & API Management

- **IoT Sensors:** Deployed in various locations to collect water quality metrics.
- **DNS Load Balancers:** Distributes incoming requests from sensors.
- **Load Balancers:** Ensures efficient request distribution among backend servers.
- **API Gateway:** Manages external and internal API requests.
  - **Public API:** For external integrations (municipalities, industrial clients).
  - **Private API:** For internal services and secure data access.

### Core Services

- **App Server:** Manages authentication, API requests, and data ingestion.
- **Authentication & Role Management:** OAuth2-based user authentication with roles: `Operator`, `Scientist`, and `Admin`.
- **Write API:** Handles data ingestion from sensors and services.
- **Read API:** Fetches processed or raw data for users and external integrations.

### Message-Driven Processing

- **RabbitMQ Message Broker:** Ensures asynchronous task execution for background processing.
- **Worker Services:**
  - **Contamination Detection Service:** Analyzes incoming sensor data for contaminants.
  - **AI Model Inference Service:** Runs ML-based contamination prediction.
  - **Predictive Analytics Service:** Generates insights on water trends and maintenance.
  - **Notification Service:** Sends alerts for contamination and system failures.
  - **Report Generation Service:** Aggregates data and generates reports.
  - **Monitoring Service:** Tracks system health and resource utilization.

### Storage & Data Management

- **PostgreSQL Cluster:** Stores structured data (sensor readings, user activity logs).
- **Redis Cache:** Caches frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.
- **Object Storage (S3):** Stores historical sensor data and generated reports.

### User Access & Dashboards

- **CDN:** Distributes frontend assets and reduces latency.
- **Load Balancer:** Manages user requests to backend servers.
- **User Dashboard:** Provides real-time data visualization and alerts.

### Challenges & Solutions

| Component               | Challenge                                        | Solution Implemented                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Load Balancers         | 10M IoT devices generating requests            | DNS Load Balancer distributes requests among multiple load balancers. |
| Database (PostgreSQL)  | Max throughput 30,000 TPS; 32 TB per table      | Implemented sharding and read replicas to scale horizontally. |
| Object Storage (S3)    | Max 3,500 PUT / 5,500 GET req/sec per bucket    | Used bucket partitioning and multi-part uploads.         |
| Task Queue (Celery Workers) | 100,000 tasks/sec for background processing | RabbitMQ clustering and horizontal scaling of workers.   |
| Caching Strategy       | Frequent queries increasing database load       | Redis caching for sensor metadata and contamination thresholds. |
| Latency Requirements   | AI model execution time must be <500ms         | Optimized ML inference service and preloaded models.     |

## Data Flow

1. **IoT Sensors** send real-time data → **Load Balancers** → **App Server**.
2. **Write API** processes data → stores in **PostgreSQL** (structured) or **S3** (raw/historical).
3. **RabbitMQ** distributes tasks → **Worker Services** process data.
4. **Contamination Detection & AI Models** analyze data → results stored in **PostgreSQL**.
5. **Predictive Analytics & Reporting** generate insights → stored in **S3**.
6. **Notifications** sent via **Notification Service** if contamination is detected.
7. **User Dashboard** fetches data via **Read API** and displays live metrics.
