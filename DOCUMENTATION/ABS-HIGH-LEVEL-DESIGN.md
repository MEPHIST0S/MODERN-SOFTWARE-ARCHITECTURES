# Water Quality Monitoring Platform Documentation

## 1. Overview

The Water Quality Monitoring Platform is designed to track and analyze water quality in real-time across municipal, industrial, and natural water sources. By leveraging IoT sensors, data analytics, and AI, the system detects contaminants, monitors chemical levels, and provides actionable insights to ensure safe and sustainable water usage.
The platform offers live dashboards for visualizing water quality metrics, automated alerts for contamination or threshold breaches, and predictive analytics for maintenance and quality improvement. It integrates seamlessly with municipal water systems, industrial plants, and environmental organizations to support effective water resource management.
Scalability and reliability are critical, as the platform must handle data from large-scale sensor deployments across various regions. Background workers process tasks like aggregating sensor data, generating reports, and sending real-time alerts. Designed for global deployments, the platform supports high availability through distributed systems and robust data management.
Additionally, the platform provides APIs for external integration, enabling interoperability with municipal systems, industrial control platforms, and environmental monitoring organizations. These APIs are designed to handle high request volumes securely, ensuring seamless communication and data exchange.
